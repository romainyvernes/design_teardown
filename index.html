              Web app accessibility appears difficult because it seems that

              Let’s take a closer look at the accessible use of framework 
              features, concrete Vue.js traits, as well as community 
              initiatives and vetted patterns.

              Too often dealing with filters can be frustrating. Let’s get 
              them right. That means never freeze the UI on a single input, 
              provide text input fallback and never auto-scroll users on a 
              single input. Here’s why.

              CSS refactoring is not an easy task — it needs to be done in a 
              way that doesn’t create problems. First we need to analyze the

              weaknesses, agree on the approach, and convince management to 
              invest time and resources into the process.
